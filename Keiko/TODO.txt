Keiko TODO list:

- lower the limit of number of torrents in LRU cache
- during boot and loading state, delete all torrents which doesn't have any piece older than X days (such job can be called once a day)
- take couple of days off
- rewrite sniffer (alternatively through fetch from peer dictionary reconstruct .torrents)
- fix monthly graphs
